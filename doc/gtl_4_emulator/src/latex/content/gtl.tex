\section{Package: lhc\_data\_pkg} \label{section_lhc_data_pkg}
The VHDL record \texttt{lhc\_data\_t} (shown in Listing \ref{lst_lhc_data_t}) is used as a container for all object streams processed by the system. It is declared in the VHDL package \texttt{lhc\_data\_pkg}.
For debugging and simulation purposes a second package (\texttt{lhc\_data\_debug\_util\_pkg}) is created which contains functions to convert the \texttt{lhc\_data\_t} to a hexadecimal string representation and vice versa.
The testbench of the design uses these functions to load the contents of the SIM memory from a file.

\subsection{Implementation in firmware}
\label{sec:gtl:implementation_firmware_gtl}

The firmware of \ugtl consists of two main parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item A top-of-hierarchy file (\texttt{gtl\_module.vhd}), which contains the pipeline for $\pm$2bx data, the instantiations of calculators for differences in $\eta$ and $\varphi$, the instantiations of conditions, the instantiations of charge correlation logic of muons and the Algorithms logic for 512 Algorithms, as well as a package file (\texttt{gtl\_pkg.vhd}) for declarations. 
Actually 6 AMC board are used to contain 512 Algorithms. Therefore the 512 Algorithms are \textbf{partitioned by VHDL Producer}.
% The VHDL Producer for every Trigger Menu (see Figure~\ref{fig:gtl:tme_gtl}) creates VHDL snippets files (\texttt{algo\_index.vhd}, \texttt{gtl\_module\_instances.vhd}, \texttt{gtl\_module\_signals.vhd}, \texttt{ugt\_constants.vhd}), these snippets are inserted into templates for \texttt{gtl\_module.vhd} and \texttt{gtl\_pkg.vhd} during simulation and synthesis.
The VHDL Producer for every Trigger Menu creates VHDL snippets files (\texttt{algo\_index.vhd}, \texttt{gtl\_module\_instances.vhd}, \texttt{gtl\_module\_signals.vhd}, \texttt{ugt\_constants.vhd}), these snippets are inserted into templates for \texttt{gtl\_module.vhd}  (\href{https://github.com/cms-l1-globaltrigger/mp7_ugt_legacy/tree/master/firmware/hdl/gt_mp7_core/gtl_fdl_wrapper/gtl/gtl_module_tpl.vhd}{\texttt{gtl\_module\_tpl.vhd}}) and \texttt{gtl\_pkg.vhd} (\href{https://github.com/cms-l1-globaltrigger/mp7_ugt_legacy/tree/master/firmware/hdl/gt_mp7_core/gtl_fdl_wrapper/gtl/gtl_pkg_tpl.vhd}{\texttt{gtl\_pkg\_tpl.vhd}}) during simulation and synthesis.
\item A set of VHDL-files exists for all the modules instantiated in top-of-hierarchy and the modules in the hierarchy. These files, called the "fixed part", are not influenced by VHDL Producer. 
\end{itemize}

% \begin{figure}[htb]
% \centering
% \includegraphics[width=15cm]{figures/tme_gtl}
% \caption{VHDL file generation by VHDL Producer} 
% \label{fig:gtl:tme_gtl}
% \end{figure}

The latency of \ugtl is fixed to 5 bunch-crossings,
2 bunch-crossings for the pipeline of $\pm$2bx data (for data with +2bx and +1bx), 2 bunch-crossings for conditions (fixed), also for the conditions requested in the future,
1 bunch-crossing for the logic of Algorithms (See Figure \ref{fig:gtl:gtl_pipeline}).\\

\subsubsection{Top-of-hierarchy module}
\label{sec:gtl:top_module}

The top-of-hierarchy module (\texttt{gtl\_module.vhd}) contains 
\begin {itemize}
\item the pipeline for $\pm$2bx data
\item the instantiations of charge correlation logic of muons (generated by VHDL Producer)
\item the instantiations of calculators for differences in $\eta$ and $\varphi$ (generated by VHDL Producer)
\item the instantiations of conditions (generated by VHDL Producer)
\item a boolean logic for Algorithms (generated by VHDL Producer)
\end {itemize}

Listing~\ref{lst:gtl_module_vhd} contains the entity-declaration of the top-of-hierarchy file (\texttt{gtl\_module.vhd}).

\subsubsection{Package module}
\label{sec:gtl:package_module}

All the declarations for arrays ('type'), parameters ('constant') and look-up-tables ('constant') used in modules are available in \texttt{gtl\_pkg.vhd} package-file.

\subsection{\ugtl structure}
\label{sec:gtl:mgtl_structure}

\subsubsection{Data $\pm$2bx}
\label{sec:gtl:data_p_m_2bx}

The \ugtl input data flow through a register pipeline of four stages. With those data it is possible to have conditions with objects from
different bunch-crossings (within $\pm$2 bunch-crossings), \eg for Correlation conditions.\\
See Figure \ref{fig:gtl:gtl_pipeline} for a scheme of \ugtl pipeline structure. The data "data\_p\_1bx" and "data\_p\_2bx" occur 1 respectively 2 bunch-crossings
after data for a certain bunch-crossing, therefore we got 2 bunch-crossings of latency from those data. The data "data\_m\_1bx" and "data\_m\_2bx" have no influence
on latency, because coming before data for a certain bunch-crossing.

\includegraphics[width=15cm]{figures/gtl_pipeline}
\caption{Scheme of \ugtl pipeline structure} 
\label{fig:gtl:gtl_pipeline}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Calculation of differences in $\eta$ and $\varphi$}
\label{sec:gtl:calculation_differences}

Some condition types namely correlation conditions uses differences in $\eta$ ($\Delta\eta$) and $\varphi$ ($\Delta\varphi$) to make the decision.
Therefore these differences are calculated out of these conditions, because the differences can be used several times in different condition types.
The differences in $\eta$ and $\varphi$ are calculated in bins. These differences in bins are converted to numbers (by LUTs),
which represents values of differences (multiples of units in $\eta$ and $\varphi$).
Differences in $\varphi$ are provided by module \href{https://github.com/cms-l1-globaltrigger/mp7_ugt_legacy/tree/master/firmware/hdl/gt_mp7_core/gtl_fdl_wrapper/gtl/sub_phi_integer_obj_vs_obj.vhd}{\texttt{sub\_phi\_integer\_obj\_vs\_obj.vhd}}, which instantiates the module \href{https://github.com/cms-l1-globaltrigger/mp7_ugt_legacy/tree/master/firmware/hdl/gt_mp7_core/gtl_fdl_wrapper/gtl/sub_unsigned_phi.vhd}{\texttt{sub\_unsigned\_phi.vhd}} as many times as
the numbers of both objects determine.\\
In the module \href{https://github.com/cms-l1-globaltrigger/mp7_ugt_legacy/tree/master/firmware/hdl/gt_mp7_core/gtl_fdl_wrapper/gtl/sub_unsigned_phi.vhd}{\texttt{sub\_unsigned\_phi.vhd}} a calculation of a difference of two objects is done, both objects must have the same resolution, namely the higher one.
The result is the absolute value of the difference.
There are two differences in $\varphi$, one "clockwise" and one "anti-clockwise". For the final result the smaller difference is taken.\\
Differences in $\eta$ are provided by module \href{https://github.com/cms-l1-globaltrigger/mp7_ugt_legacy/tree/master/firmware/hdl/gt_mp7_core/gtl_fdl_wrapper/gtl/sub_eta_integer_obj_vs_obj.vhd}{\texttt{sub\_eta\_integer\_obj\_vs\_obj.vhd}}, which instantiates the module \href{https://github.com/cms-l1-globaltrigger/mp7_ugt_legacy/tree/master/firmware/hdl/gt_mp7_core/gtl_fdl_wrapper/gtl/sub_unsigned_eta.vhd}{\texttt{sub\_unsigned\_eta.vhd}} as many times as the numbers of both objects determine.\\
In the module \href{https://github.com/cms-l1-globaltrigger/mp7_ugt_legacy/tree/master/firmware/hdl/gt_mp7_core/gtl_fdl_wrapper/gtl/sub_unsigned_eta.vhd}{\texttt{sub\_unsigned\_eta.vhd}} a calculation of a difference of two objects is done with a signed subtraction, because of the Two's Complement notation of $\eta$ values.
The result is the absolute value of the difference. 

\subsubsection{Calorimeter conditions}

\paragraph{Calorimeter conditions definition}
\label{sec:gtl:calo_cond_def}

A condition consists of calorimeter objects as input data and a set of requirements, which contain the requirements to be complied.

The requirement for calorimeter conditions contains:\\
one threshold for \et, ranges for $\eta$, $\varphi$ LUTs for isolation and differences in $\eta$ and $\varphi$. In addition the selection of the "relative bx" of objects
is done in the requirement.\\
The condition is complied, if every comparison between object parameters and requirements is valid for the following equation:
\begin{itemize}
\item \et greater-equal (or equal) threshold
\item $\eta$ in range
\item $\varphi$ in range
\item isolation as requested (for \egamma and tau)
\end{itemize}
\textit{Additional comparisons for "quality information" could be part of the equation - but not defined yet.}

There are different types of calorimeter conditions implemented, depending of how many objects have to comply the requirements.
\begin{itemize}
\item "Quad objects requirements condition": this condition type consists of requirements for 4 different trigger objects of the same object type. 
For each object the requirements can be different. To fulfill this condition, there must exist at least one set of 4 different objects,
each of which fulfills at least one of the requirements.
\item "Triple objects requirements condition": this condition type consists of requirements for 3 different trigger objects of the same object type. 
For each object the requirements can be different. To fulfill this condition, there must exist at least one set of 3 different objects,
each of which fulfills at least one of the requirements.
\item "Double objects requirements condition": this condition type consists of requirements for 2 different trigger objects of the same object type. 
For each object the requirements can be different. To fulfill this condition, there must exist at least one set of 2 different objects,
each of which fulfills at least one of the requirements.\footnote{"Double objects requirements condition with spatial correlation" not used anymore, replaced by Correlation conditions}
\item "Single object requirement condition": this condition type consists of one requirement for one trigger object of a given object type. 
To fulfill this condition, there must exist at least one object which fulfills the requirement.

\end{itemize}

The selection of the mode of \et-comparator (greater/equal or equal), the \et-threshold-value, ranges for $\eta$ and $\varphi$ set with thresholds, LUTs for isolation and ranges for differences in $\eta$ and $\varphi$ set with thresholds are fixed values given by VHDL Producer for every Trigger Menu.
The objects have to be of same type and same bunch-crossing.

\subparagraph{Calorimeter conditions module}
\label{sec:gtl:calo_conditions_module}

The module for conditions with calorimeter objects (\href{https://github.com/cms-l1-globaltrigger/mp7_ugt_legacy/tree/master/firmware/hdl/gt_mp7_core/gtl_fdl_wrapper/gtl/calo_conditions.vhd}{\texttt{calo\_conditions.vhd}}) instantiates the calorimeter comparators module (\href{https://github.com/cms-l1-globaltrigger/mp7_ugt_legacy/tree/master/firmware/hdl/gt_mp7_core/gtl_fdl_wrapper/gtl/calo_comparators.vhd}{\texttt{calo\_comparators.vhd}}) as many times as the numbers of objects and requirements determine. Depending on the condition-type, different and-or-structures of object vs. requirement are selected.
The selection of condition-type and the number of objects is done by parameters in the generic interface list of the module (see Listing~\ref{lst:calo_conditions_vhd},
see also the explanations below).\\
For comparison in $\eta$, $\varphi$ and the differences in $\eta$ and $\varphi$, "window"-comparators are used.\\
In the calorimeter conditions module a cut for two-body pt calculation can be selected. Therefore a threshold value for two-body pt is required.

\subparagraph{Calorimeter Overlap Remover conditions module}
\label{sec:gtl:calo_conditions_orm_module}
The Calorimeter Overlap Remover conditions consits of a Calorimeter condition (\ref{sec:gtl:calo_conditions_module}) and a single condition for a different calo object type. One or more correlation cut(s) ($\Delta\eta$, $\Delta\varphi$ and $\Delta$R - \ref{sec:gtl:correlation_conditions}) for overlap removal is required between different calo object types.
Overlap Remover conditions \href{https://github.com/cms-l1-globaltrigger/mp7_ugt_legacy/tree/master/firmware/hdl/gt_mp7_core/gtl_fdl_wrapper/gtl/calo_conditions_orm.vhd}{\texttt{calo\_conditions\_orm.vhd}} are implemented only for calo object types.

\subparagraph{Calorimeter comparators module}
\label{sec:gtl:calo_comp_module}
A comparator between the energy (\et) and a threshold (et\_threshold) and a comparison in $\eta$ with five "window"-comparators and $\varphi$ with two "window"-comparators
is done in this basic module. The values for \et threshold, the 'mode-selection' for the \et comparator and the "limits" of the "window"-comparators is given in the generic interface list of the module. Additionally the data-structure of input data (data\_i in port interface list) is provided as a record in this list. The output signal of the module is in high state, if all comparisons are true.\\
The comparison in $\eta$ is done with five "window"-comparators, so one gets max. five ranges for $\eta$. The $\eta$ value (HW index) has a Two's Complement notation, the comparisons is done signed. Number of windows is given for $\eta$.\\
The comparison in $\varphi$ is done with two "window"-comparators, so one gets two ranges for $\varphi$. The comparisons is done unsigned. There are two flags, one for "full-range" and one for "ignore-second-window" for the selection of the ranges.\\
There are two cases how the limits of one "window"-comparator could be set (see also Figure~\ref{fig:gtl:phi_windows_comparator} and Listing~\ref{lst:phi_window_comparator_vhd}):
\begin{itemize}
\item Upper limit is less than lower limit => $\varphi$ range between the limits, including the $\varphi$ bin with value = 0 (HW index).
\item Upper limit is greater/equal than lower limit => $\varphi$ range between the limits, not including the $\varphi$ bin with value = 0 (HW index).
\end{itemize}
The comparison of isolation (for \egamma and tau) is done with LUTs.
\begin{lstlisting}[label=lst:phi_window_comparator_vhd,float=here,caption=VHDL code of "window"-comparator in $\varphi$,captionpos=t]
    phi_comp_w1 <= '1' when phi_w1_upper_limit < phi_w1_lower_limit and
                    (phi <= phi_w1_upper_limit or phi >= phi_w1_lower_limit) else
                   '1' when phi_w1_upper_limit >= phi_w1_lower_limit and
                    (phi <= phi_w1_upper_limit and phi >= phi_w1_lower_limit)
                    else '0';
\end{lstlisting}

The values of $\eta$ and $\varphi$ have to be inside of only one of the required ranges ("or").

The comparison of isolation (for \egamma and tau) is done with LUTs (see Table~\ref{tab:gtl:calo_lut_iso}).
Only the least significant 4 bits of LUT are used, because currently 2 isolation bits are defined.

\paragraph{Energy sum quantities conditions module (including Asymmetry conditions)}

For the entity-declaration see \href{https://github.com/cms-l1-globaltrigger/mp7_ugt_legacy/tree/master/firmware/hdl/gt_mp7_core/gtl_fdl_wrapper/gtl/esums_conditions.vhd}{\texttt{esums\_conditions.vhd}}.\\
A comparator between \et and a threshold (et\_threshold) and, depending on object type, a comparison in $\varphi$ with 
two "window"-comparators is done in this module. 
The value for \et threshold, the 'mode-selection' for the \et comparator and the limits for the "window"-comparators are given in the generic interface list of the module.
The selection whether a comparison in $\varphi$ is part of the condition is done with the value of the generic parameter 'obj\_type' 
('ETM\_TYPE', 'ETMHF\_TYPE', 'HTM\_TYPE' and 'HTMHF\_TYPE' force a comparison).
The comparison in $\varphi$ is done in the same way as for calorimeter conditions (see \ref{sec:gtl:calo_comp_module}).
Additionally the data-structure of input data (data\_i in port interface list) is provided
as a record in this list. The output signal of the module is in high state, if all comparisons are true.\\
Data for Asymmetry trigger are received on 4 frames on bits 27..20 (8 bits). For every type a comparision with an 8-bit threshold (greater-equal [or equal]) is done.
Asymmetry data are interpreted as counts.

\subsubsection{Minimum bias trigger conditions}
\label{sec:gtl:min_bias_conditions}

Data for Minimum bias trigger are received on the 4 MSBs of 4 frames used for Energy sum quantities (see \ref{sec:gtl:esums_conditions}).

\item MBT0HFP: "minimum bias HF+ threshold 0" bits
\item MBT0HFM: "minimum bias HF- threshold 0" bits
\item MBT1HFP: "minimum bias HF+ threshold 1" bits
\item MBT1HFM: "minimum bias HF- threshold 1" bits
\end{itemize}

In minimum bias trigger conditions module (\href{https://github.com/cms-l1-globaltrigger/mp7_ugt_legacy/tree/master/firmware/hdl/gt_mp7_core/gtl_fdl_wrapper/gtl/min_bias_hf_conditions.vhd}{\texttt{min\_bias\_hf\_conditions.vhd}}) there is a comparision with a 4-bit threshold (greater-equal [or equal]).

\subsubsection{Towercount condition}
\label{sec:gtl:towercount_cond}

Data for Towercount trigger (number of firing HCAL towers) are received on frame \htt (see \ref{sec:gtl:esums_conditions}) on bits 24..12 (13 bits) of \htt data structure.\\ 
In towercount condition module (\href{https://github.com/cms-l1-globaltrigger/mp7_ugt_legacy/tree/master/firmware/hdl/gt_mp7_core/gtl_fdl_wrapper/gtl/towercount\_condition.vhd}{\texttt{towercount\_condition.vhd}}) there is a comparision with a 13-bit threshold (greater-equal [or equal]).

Centrality bits used as a signals for triggers (similar to external signals).

\subsubsection{Muon conditions}

\paragraph{Muon data}
\label{sec:gtl:muon_data}
Eight Muon objects are provided by \gmt. One Muon object has a 64 bits data structure with parameters for \pt, for position, charge, quality and isolation information: 
\begin{itemize}
\item 10 bits azimuth angle ($\varphi$) position, range = 2$\pi$, step $\approx$ 2$\pi$/576 (\^=0.625°), 576 bins (HW index = 0..0x23F), HW index starting at 0° (anti-clockwise)
\item 9 bits \pt, range = 0..255 GeV (HW index = 0..0x1FF), step = 0.5, the highest bin will mark an overflow (HW index 0x1FF): meaning has to be defined
\item 4 bits quality, 16 types for quality (meaning not defined yet!)
\item 9 (8+1 sign) bits pseudo-rapidity ($\eta$) position, range = -2.45 to 2.45, step = 0.087/8, linear scale, 452 bins (-225..225, HW index = 0x11F..0x0E1)
\item 2 bits isolation, 4 types for isolation (meaning not defined yet!)
\item 1 bit charge sign, charge sign = '0' means "positive" charge, charge sign = '1' means "negative" charge
\item 1 bit charge valid (='1' means "valid")
\item 7 index bits
\item 10 bits azimuth angle ($\varphi$) position, raw data
\item 8 bits unconstrained \pt, range = 0..255 GeV (HW index = 0..0xFF), step = 1.0, the highest bin will mark an overflow (HW index 0xFF)
\item 1 spare bit
\item 2 bits impact parameter

The central value of the bin 0 (-0.010875/2 to +0.010875/2) = 0.0, the left edge of the bins will range from $-255 \times 0.010875 - 0.010875/2 = -2.7785625$ to $+255 \times 0.010875 - 0.010875/2 = 2.7676875$.
The central value of the bins will range between $\pm 2.773125$ . The physical $\eta$ range of the muon detectors is about $\pm2.45$, so that not all possible $\eta$ bins will be used.\\

\paragraph{Muon charge correlation module}
\label{sec:gtl:muon_charge_correlation_module}

For definition of muon charge, see \ref{sec:gtl:muon_conditions}.\\
In the muon charge correlation module (\href{https://github.com/cms-l1-globaltrigger/mp7_ugt_legacy/tree/master/firmware/hdl/gt_mp7_core/gtl_fdl_wrapper/gtl/muon_charge_correlations.vhd}{\texttt{muon\_charge\_correlations.vhd}}), the charge correlations are made for different muon conditions-types. The module is instantiated in the top-of-hierarchy module (\texttt{gtl\_module.vhd})
and not inside of a muon conditions module. 
The charges of objects (number of objects depends on muon condition type) are compared to get "like sign charge" ("LS") or "opposite sign charge" ("0S"), "LS" means that the charges (charge sign)
of objects are the same, "0S" means that at least one object has different charge than the others. This information is used in all instatiated muon conditions.
There is no charge correlation for single type conditions.\\
In all cases the "charge valid" bit of the objects must be set.\\
In TME one can select "LS", "0S" or ignore for charge correlation in muon conditions.\\

\paragraph{Muon conditions definition}
\label{sec:gtl:muon_cond_def}

A condition consists of input-data and a set of requirements, which contain the requirements to be complied.

The requirement for muon conditions contains:\\
a threshold for \pt, a threshold for unconstrained \pt, ranges for $\eta$ and $\varphi$, a LUT for quality, a LUT for isolation, 
a requsted charge, a LUT for impact parameter.
The condition is complied, if every comparison between object parameters and requirements is valid for the following object cuts (only for requested cuts):
\begin{itemize}
\item \pt greater-equal (or equal) threshold
\item unconstrained \pt greater-equal (or equal) threshold
\item $\eta$ in range
\item $\varphi$ in range
\item requested charge 
\item quality LUT
\item iso LUT
\item impact parameter LUT
\end{itemize}

There are different types of calorimeter conditions implemented, depending of how many objects have to comply the requirements.
\begin{itemize}
\item "Quad objects requirements condition": this condition type consists of requirements for 4 different trigger objects of the same object type. 
For each object the requirements can be different. To fulfill this condition, there must exist at least one set of 4 different objects,
each of which fulfills at least one of the requirements.
\item "Triple objects requirements condition": this condition type consists of requirements for 3 different trigger objects of the same object type. 
For each object the requirements can be different. To fulfill this condition, there must exist at least one set of 3 different objects,
each of which fulfills at least one of the requirements.
\item "Double objects requirements condition": this condition type consists of requirements for 2 different trigger objects of the same object type. 
For each object the requirements can be different. To fulfill this condition, there must exist at least one set of 2 different objects,
each of which fulfills at least one of the requirements.\footnote{"Double objects requirements condition with spatial correlation" not used anymore, replaced by Correlation conditions}
\item "Single object requirement condition": this condition type consists of one requirement for one trigger object of a given object type. 
To fulfill this condition, there must exist at least one object which fulfills the requirement.

\end{itemize}

In addition requested charge correlation must be matched (except for "Single object requirement condition", there is no charge correlation).
The calculation of charge correlations is done in an own module in the top-of-hierarchy module (\texttt{gtl\_module.vhd}).\\

\subparagraph{Muon conditions module}
\label{sec:gtl:muon_condidions_module}

A module for conditions with muon objects (\href{https://github.com/cms-l1-globaltrigger/mp7_ugt_legacy/tree/master/firmware/hdl/gt_mp7_core/gtl_fdl_wrapper/gtl/muon_conditions.vhd}{\texttt{muon\_conditions.vhd}}) instantiates the muon comparators module (\href{https://github.com/cms-l1-globaltrigger/mp7_ugt_legacy/tree/master/firmware/hdl/gt_mp7_core/gtl_fdl_wrapper/gtl/muon_comparators.vhd}{\texttt{muon\_comparators.vhd}}) as many times as the numbers of objects and requirements determine. Depending on the condition-type different and-or-structures of object vs. requirement are selected.
The selection of condition-type and the number of objects is done by parameters in the generic interface list of the module.

\subparagraph{Muon comparators module}
\label{sec:gtl:muon_comp_module}

A comparator between \pt and a threshold (pt\_threshold), a comparator between unconstrained \pt and a threshold (upt\_threshold), a comparison in $\eta$ with five "window"-comparators and $\varphi$ with two "window"-comparators, a comparison of quality with LUT, a comparison of isolation with LUT and a comparison of the requested charge is done in this basic module. The values for \pt threshold, unconstrained \pt threshold, the 'mode-selection' for the \pt comparator, the "limits" of the "window"-comparators, the quality LUTs, the isolation LUTs and the requested charge is given in the generic interface list of the module.
Additionally the data-structure of input data (data\_i in port interface list) is provided as a record in this list. The output signal of the module is in high state, if all comparisons are true.\\
The comparison in $\eta$ is done with five "window"-comparators, so one gets max. five ranges for $\eta$. The $\eta$ value (HW index) has a Two's Complement notation, the comparisons is done signed. Number of windows is given for $\eta$.\\
The comparison in $\varphi$ is done with two "window"-comparators, so one gets two ranges for $\varphi$. The comparisons is done unsigned. There are two flags, one for "full-range" and one for "ignore-second-window" for the selection of the ranges.\\
There are two cases how the limits of one "window"-comparator could be set (see also Figure~\ref{fig:gtl:phi_windows_comparator} and Listing~\ref{lst:phi_window_comparator_vhd}):
\begin{itemize}
\item Upper limit is less than lower limit => $\varphi$ range between the limits, including the $\varphi$ bin with value = 0 (HW index).
\item Upper limit is greater/equal than lower limit => $\varphi$ range between the limits, not including the $\varphi$ bin with value = 0 (HW index).
\end{itemize}

The values of $\eta$ and $\varphi$ have to be inside of only one of the two required ranges ("or").

Charge valid and charge sign bits must be equal to the requested charge.\\
The comparison of quality is done with LUT. To ignore quality comparison, all bits in the LUT have to be '1'.\\

\begin{table}[htdp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|c|}\hline

\subsubsection{Correlation conditions}
\label{sec:gtl:correlation_conditions}

The correlation conditions contain a combination of two "Single object requirement conditions" of two object types or one "Double objects requirement condition" of objects of the same type. In addition with "object requirements" there are cuts for $\Delta\eta$, $\Delta\varphi$, $\Delta$R, mass and "two-body pt".\\

The following cuts can be used:
\begin{itemize}
\item Cut for $\Delta\eta$.
\item Cut for $\Delta\varphi$.
\item Cut for $\Delta$R.
\item Cuts for mass (MASS) of following mass types:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Cut for Invariant mass.
  \item Cut for Invariant mass with unconstrained pt (only for muons).
  \item Cut for Invariant mass divided by $\Delta$R.
  \item Cut for Transverse mass.
  \end{itemize}
\item Cut for Two-body pt.
\end{itemize}

There is one correlation condition type for a mass cut with three objects:
\begin{itemize}
\item Cut for invariant mass for three objects (MASS).
\end{itemize}

\label{fig:gtl:scheme_vhdl_cuts_correllation_condition}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Calculation of cuts}
\label{sec:gtl:delta_r_calculation}

Calculation of $\Delta\eta$ and $\Delta\varphi$ see section "Calculation of differences in $\eta$ and $\varphi$" (\ref{sec:gtl:calculation_differences}).

\subparagraph{$\Delta$R calculation}
\label{sec:gtl:delta_r_calculation}

The calculation of \textit{$\Delta$R} of two objects is done with formula:\\ 

$\Delta$$R=\sqrt{(\eta_1-\eta_2)^2+(\varphi_1-\varphi_2)^2}$.\\

In the TME there are two thresholds for $\Delta$R: "greater/equal lower limit" and "less/equal upper limit", given in floating point notation
with one position after decimal point.
The comparison in VHDL is done with $\Delta$$R^2$ (no square root in VHDL), thresholds for $\Delta$$R^2$ are provided by VHDL-Producer.

\subparagraph{Invariant mass calculation}
\label{sec:gtl:inv_mass_calculation}

The calculation of \textit{invariant mass of two objects} is done with formula:\\

M=$\sqrt{2 pt_1  pt_2 (\cosh(\eta_1-\eta_2)-\cos(\varphi_1-\varphi_2))}$.\\

In the TME there are two thresholds for M: "greater/equal lower limit" and "less/equal upper limit", given in GeV (floating point notation) with one position after decimal point in even numbers.\footnote{even numbers to get a precision of one position after decimal point after dividion by 2, because VHDL-Producer calculates thresholds for $\frac{M^2}{2}$, which includes a division by 2.}
The comparison in VHDL is done with $\frac{M^2}{2}$ (no square root in VHDL), thresholds for $\frac{M^2}{2}$ are provided by VHDL-Producer.

\subparagraph{Transverse mass calculation}
\label{sec:gtl:transverse_mass_calculation}

The calculation of \textit{transverse mass of two objects} is done with formula:\\

M=$\sqrt{2 pt_1 pt_2 (1-\cos(\varphi_1-\varphi_2))}$.\\

In the TME there are two thresholds for M: "greater/equal lower limit" and "less/equal upper limit", given in GeV (floating point notation) with one position after decimal point in even numbers.\\
The comparison in VHDL is done with $\frac{M^2}{2}$ (no square root in VHDL), thresholds for $\frac{M^2}{2}$ are provided by VHDL-Producer.

\subparagraph{Two-body pt calculation}
\label{sec:gtl:twobody_pt_calculation}

The calculation of \textit{two-body pt} is done with formula:\\

pt=$\sqrt{pt^2_1 + pt^2_2 + 2  pt_1 pt_2 (\cos(\varphi_1) \cos(\varphi_2) + \sin(\varphi_1) \sin(\varphi_2))}$\\

In the TME there is one threshold for pt, given in GeV (floating point notation) with one position after decimal point.
The comparison in VHDL is done with ${pt^2}$ (no square root in VHDL), threshold for ${pt^2}$ is provided by VHDL-Producer.

\subparagraph{Invariant mass divided by $\Delta$R calculation}
\label{sec:gtl:inv_mass_div_dr_calculation}

The formulas for \textit{invariant mass divided by $\Delta$R of two objects} are:\\

M=$\sqrt{2 pt_1  pt_2 (\cosh(\eta_1-\eta_2)-\cos(\varphi_1-\varphi_2))}$.\\

$\Delta$$R=\sqrt{(\eta_1-\eta_2)^2+(\varphi_1-\varphi_2)^2}$.\\

In the TME there is one threshold for M/$\Delta$R, given in GeV (floating point notation) with one position after decimal point.
The calculation of \textit{invariant mass divided by $\Delta$R of two objects} is done in an own module outside of the condition (\href{https://github.com/cms-l1-globaltrigger/mp7_ugt_legacy/tree/master/firmware/hdl/gt_mp7_core/gtl_fdl_wrapper/gtl/mass_div_dr_calculator.vhd}{\texttt{mass\_div\_dr\_calculator.vhd}}) with $\frac{M^2}{2}\times$(1/$\Delta$$R^2$) (no square root in VHDL). This module is instantiated once for every object type bunch-crossing combination.\\  
The values of 1/$\Delta$$R^2$ in VHDL are given by LUTs stored in BRAMs (as ROMs). The addresses of the BRAMs are given by $\Delta\eta$ and $\Delta\varphi$. The contents of the LUTs are created by calculating 1/$\Delta$$R^2$, rounding-up at the 5\textsuperscript{th} position after decimal point and multiplying by 100000 to get integer values.\\

\subparagraph{Invariant mass calculation for three objects}
\label{sec:gtl:inv_mass_3_obj_calculation}

The calculation of \textit{invariant mass calculation for three objects} is done by calculating the invariant mass for all two-object combinations and take the sum of the three invariant masses of the two-object combinations.\\
In the TME there are two thresholds for M: "greater/equal lower limit" and "less/equal upper limit", given in GeV (floating point notation) with one position after decimal point in even numbers.

\paragraph{Correlation condition modules}
\label{sec:gtl:correlation_condition_modules}

\subparagraph{Calo Calo Correlation condition module}
\label{sec:gtl:calo_calo_correlation_condition_module}

The calo calo correlation condition module contains two "Single object requirement conditions" for different types of calo objects (\egamma, jet or tau) or same type with data from different bunch-crossings as one possible mode and a "Double objects requirement condition" for calo objects of same type and same bunch-crossing as a second mode (selection is done by a parameter in the generic list of \href{https://github.com/cms-l1-globaltrigger/mp7_ugt_legacy/tree/master/firmware/hdl/gt_mp7_core/gtl_fdl_wrapper/gtl/calo_calo_correlation_condition.vhd}{\texttt{calo\_calo\_correlation\_condition.vhd}} named "same\_bx").\\
In addition there are "Cuts" for differences in $\eta$ ($\Delta\eta$) and $\varphi$ ($\Delta\varphi$), a calculation of $\Delta$R (DR), a calculation of invariant mass (MASS) and a calculation of two-body pt, see Figure~\ref{fig:gtl:scheme_vhdl_cuts_correllation_condition}.\\

The Calo Calo Overlap Remover Correlation conditions consits of two modes. One with a Calo Calo Correlation condition with "Double objects requirement condition" for calo objects of same type and same bunch-crossing (\ref{sec:gtl:calo_calo_correlation_condition_module}) and a single condition for a different calo object type (can have different bunch-crossing too). There has to be at least one correlation cut for the objects of "Double objects requirement condition" and a correlation cut for overlap removal between objects (one or more cut(s) of $\Delta\eta$, $\Delta\varphi$ and $\Delta$R) of different object types ("2plus1"). A second mode ("1plus1") with a Calo Calo Correlation condition with a single condition and a different calo object type (can have different bunch-crossing too) also with a single condition. There has to be at least one correlation cut for the different objects (e.g. invariant mass) and a correlation cut for overlap removal between the objects (one or more cut(s) of $\Delta\eta$, $\Delta\varphi$ and $\Delta$R).
